## Code Style Guidelines

### C# Conventions
- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase for private fields with underscore prefix (`_fieldName`)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs

### XAML Conventions
- Use x:Name for elements that need code-behind access
- Group related properties together
- Use static resources for colors and styles

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs when applicable
